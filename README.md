Garbage Card Game using the Deck of Cards API
##Issues
won rounds need to be counted to lead up to win of the game

taking of the card from the opponents discarded card function to be made

Queen function needs to read if the spot already has a card in the right spot, if so say spot filled and ask which spot again

when card in hand happens to be in right spot but marked false -> marked true
