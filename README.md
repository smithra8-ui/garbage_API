Garbage Card Game using the Deck of Cards API
##Issues
Each turn needs time between so players can see each turn rather than the code spiting it all out

need to add code for when a player wins the round or the game

ACE cards need to be read as a "1" card

Queen function needs to read if the spot already has a card in the right spot, if so say spot filled and ask which spot again

when card in hand happens to be in right spot but marked false -> marked true

Used card "pile" to change from list to singular value for simplification
